/**
 * A single insight. [F7.2 / F7.5]
 *
 * Voice: the prose comes verbatim from hand-written backend templates filled with
 * hard data — we render `text`, we never generate or decorate it. Every insight
 * shows its BASIS ("from N books", where N is `insight.n`); the receipts are what
 * make the verdict believable. The headline insight (highest surprise) is rendered
 * larger, but it is the same shape — no special copy.
